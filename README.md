# Software Authorship

:link: Website: https://sdruskat.net/software-authorship/

### A [Collaborations Workshop 2023](https://software.ac.uk/cw23) hack activity

The aims of this hack day activity are to define guidelines for authorship of software.
This activity is necessary because existing authorship guidelines, e.g., for papers, are not easily transferable to software.

The new guidelines will define:

- The importance of authorship specifically for software, taking into account:
    - The different authorship roles for software
    - Different contribution roles
    - The dynamic nature of software development, and different versions of what is perceived to be the “same thing”
- Who is a software author, specifically:
    - What criteria are for software authorship
    - How these criteria can be applied (giving examples)
- Who is a non-author contributor,
    - including example roles of contributors (eg raising bug issues, fixing typos)
    - including guidelines for how to identify when an contributor has transitioned to author, and when an author stops being an author
- When and how authors and contributors should be credited,
    - and how the roles may be mapped to authorship and contributorship of related outputs (such as software papers, papers about the software, etc.).

This activity focuses on authorship of software (“the software itself”). It does not discuss specifics of authorship for related outputs (software papers, papers about software, etc.).

## Outputs

1. A draft for a definition of authorship for research software. This draft will be proposed to the community to refine it and gain support from relevant stakeholders (such as [FORCE11](https://force11.org/) and [ReSA](https://www.researchsoft.org/)).
2. A proposal for a list of authorship and contribution roles for software, and their relationship to existing roles taxonomies and lists. This also includes more detailed definitions of the single roles, including examples.
