<!--
This website was created as a [hack day activity for the Collaborations Workshop 2023](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw23/hack-day) with the aim to define guidelines for authorship of software.

This activity is necessary because existing authorship guidelines, e.g., for papers, are not easily transferable to software.

The new guidelines will define:

- The importance of authorship specifically for software, taking into account:
    - The different authorship roles for software
    - Different contribution roles
    - The dynamic nature of software development, and different versions of what is perceived to be the “same thing”
- Who is a software author, specifically:
    - What criteria are for software authorship
    - How these criteria can be applied (giving examples)
- Who is a non-author contributor,
    - including example roles of contributors (eg raising bug issues, fixing typos)
    - including guidelines for how to identify when an contributor has transitioned to author, and when an author stops being an author
- When and how authors and contributors should be credited

This activity focuses on authorship of software (“the software itself”). It does not discuss specifics of authorship for related outputs (software papers, papers about software, etc.).

## What do you need to do as a project?

As a research software project, it's useful to be clear and transparent who the authors of your software are, acknowledge contributors, and describe how decisions around authorship are made. 

- Authorship: the list of authors should be clearly stated, and ideally made available in a machine readable form as well (e.g. using CodeMeta). A preferred citation for the software project (e.g. in a CFF file) should be included to make it easy to give credit to the authors.  
- Contributors: people who have made useful contributions to a project should be acknowledged in documentation, and ideally in project metadata (e.g. in the DOI metadata or in a CodeMeta file).
- Governance: the way the project decides who is an author and who is a contributor should be transparently and publicly documented.

An appropriate place to put this information is in a contribution section in your README or a separate CONTRIBUTING file. There are good existing guidelines for how to structure a project README and CONTRIBUTING file.
