This website was created as a [hack day activity for the Collaborations Workshop 2023](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw23/hack-day) with the aim to define guidelines for authorship of software.

This activity is necessary because existing authorship guidelines, e.g., for papers, are not easily transferable to software.

The new guidelines will define:

- The importance of authorship specifically for software, taking into account:
    - The different authorship roles for software
    - Different contribution roles
    - The dynamic nature of software development, and different versions of what is perceived to be the “same thing”
- Who is a software author, specifically:
    - What criteria are for software authorship
    - How these criteria can be applied (giving examples)
- Who is a non-author contributor,
    - including example roles of contributors (eg raising bug issues, fixing typos)
    - including guidelines for how to identify when an contributor has transitioned to author, and when an author stops being an author
- When and how authors and contributors should be credited

This activity focuses on authorship of software (“the software itself”). It does not discuss specifics of authorship for related outputs (software papers, papers about software, etc.).
